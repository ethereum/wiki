# Ethereum Wallet Syncing Problems

One of the most common problems with the Ethereum Wallet application is keeping the blockchain in sync with the Ethereum network. This page describes some of the common issues users may encounter while trying to sync the blockchain and potential methods to work around the problems.

**Note that Ethereum Wallet will not display your account balance correctly when it is not synced fully or correctly**.


## Unable To Sync

Check that your the clock on your computer is close to real time. Change your system settings so that your system clock is synced to an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server.


## Slow Syncing Between Blocks 2,283,397 And 2,717,576

You may be encountering some problems syncing Ethereum Wallet (or Mist) to the Mainnet blockchain. A common problem when syncing Ethereum Wallet's blockchain data is that the syncing slows down between blocks 2,283,397 and 2,620,384 due to the attack on the Ethereum network (reference [Why is my node synchronization stuck/extremely slow at block 2,306,843?](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/9883/why-is-my-node-synchronization-stuck-extremely-slow-at-block-2-306-843).

The syncing also slows down between blocks 2,675,055 and 2,717,576 due to the state clearing process to remove the 20 million empty accounts created by the network attack.


## How to recover from slow syncing?

If you have a problem with slow syncing, the easiest way to recover from this slowdown is to remove your blockchain data and restart Ethereum Wallet. Ethereum Wallet will then perform a fast sync which skips over these attack blocks.

**WARNING: Make sure you back up your keystore directory so you don't accidentally delete your account information.**

Shut down Ethereum Wallet.

Depending on your operating system, you will find the <code>chaindata</code> subdirectory in:
* Linux - ```$HOME/.ethereum/geth```
* OS/X - ```$HOME/Library/Ethereum``` or ```$HOME/Library/Ethereum/geth```
* Windows - ```%APPDATA%/Ethereum```

Remove the ```chaindata``` directory.

Alternatively, you can run ```geth removedb``` to remove the blockchain data.

Start Ethereum Wallet. It should now start fast syncing the blockchain data. Alternatively, run ```geth --syncmode "fast" --cache 1024 console``` and then start Ethereum Wallet.

Refer to *Network Ports, Files And Directories* for more information on the location of Ethereum software files and directories on your computer.

Another method to reduce sync-time is to run your copy of the blockchain from a Solid State Drive (SSD) as rotational drives are much more affected by the I/O generated by the clearing process, if you are running a full sync.


## How can I tell if my node client is fast syncing or not?

Compare your logging messages with the following logging messages to determine whethere your node client is fast syncing or normal syncing.


### Fast Sync In Progress

The following messages are displayed on the `geth --syncmode "fast" console` (pre 1.6.0) screen - note the **header(s)** and **receipt(s)**:
```
 I0416 13:35:53.497422   30629 blockchain.go:889] imported 192 header(s) (0 ignored) in 71.941018ms. #6336 [2edbbc3f… / b80c9ac3…]
 I0416 13:35:54.263134   30629 blockchain.go:1044] imported 192 receipt(s) (0 ignored) in 55.447062ms. #6336 [2edbbc3f… / b80c9ac3…]

```

And following is the equivalent ```geth``` 1.6.0 (Testnet) message during a fast sync:
```

```
### Fast Sync Just Completed, Transitioning To Normal Sync

Here is the transition when the `--syncmode "fast"` syncing (pre 1.6.0) has completed and normal syncing starts:
```
 I0416 17:16:12.631667   30629 blockchain.go:1251] imported 195 block(s) (0 queued 0 ignored) including 0 txs in 1.235990428s. #384 [d707e667 / d3d5d5c1]

```

And following is the equivalent ```geth``` 1.6.0 message during the transition:

```

### Normal Sync In Progress

And the following messages are displayed on the `geth console` (pre 1.6.0) screen - note the '''block(s)''':
```
 I0416 13:32:23.331906   30581 blockchain.go:1251] imported 256 block(s) (0 queued 0 ignored) including 0 txs in 979.938402ms. #6366 [66dcf4c1 / c5d009a1]

```

And following is the equivalent ```geth``` 1.6.0 message from a full sync transitioning to incremental single block updates. The blocks will sync in batches, and when your blockchain data is up to date, single blocks are received approximately every 14 seconds:
```

## Alternatives

### Use Parity Node Client And User Interface

You can use Parity and start the Parity syncing using the following command line parameter for a reasonably quick sync:
```
 parity --warp
```
You can access the Parity user interface by navigating in your browser to **http://localhost:8080** .


### Use Parity Node Client With Ethereum Wallet

You can use Parity as a back end to Ethereum Wallet. Start Parity with the following command line
```
 parity --warp --geth
```
You can then start Ethereum Wallet and it will connect to your Parity instance.

Hello! Chances areÂ you're in the wrong place.

If you have a technical issue with a specific client, application or tool, e.g. those listed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients,-tools,-dapp-browsers,-wallets-and-other-projects), please ask in the Gitter room of that project, and if your issue is still not resolved, post an issue in the repo for that project. This repository is only used for the wiki, and issues here are only relevant if they are directly about the wiki.

Please only create an issue here if:
- You've spotted something in the wiki that you can't fix it by editing it yourself
- Your problem hasn't been resolved on the [Gitter documentation room](https://gitter.im/ethereum/documentation). You've tried pinging someone who knows how to handle the issue, or asking who this might be, and then asking them.
- You've waited at least a couple of days for responses on Gitter.
- And **only** if it is related to the wiki.

Thank you. If your issue was previously closed, see the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on closed issues.

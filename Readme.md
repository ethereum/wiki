# Contribution guidelines
If you are translating an article, please create a new page and create the translation in that. Do not edit an existing article by translating it. Someone did this with the home wiki, changing the title, and this actually caused the home page to just direct to a list of pages in the wiki, and made it hard to find the edited home page as the title was changed to Arabic.

If you have experience with editing on Wikipedia, then that will help with knowing how to edit this wiki, although the contribution rules are less strict. Referencing facts is a key writing and proofreading task, as well as checking that information is up-to-date (and updating it if otherwise), correcting grammar, typos, and spelling; and making the wiki comprehensive and easy to understand.

Other rules, such as a neutral point of view and no original research are desirable, but may be hard to maintain. Notability is less relevant.

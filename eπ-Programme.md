# The Ethereum Raspberry Pi (eπ) Programme

The eπ programme is aimed to get as many nodes distributed around the world as possible. Any existing Ethereum meetup group is eligible to apply.

We will offer to loan the group a set of equipment to run an Ethereum node. This will include:

- Raspberry Pi 2 Model B;
- 64 GB fast memory card;
- PSU.

We expect you guys to be the ones to run the install (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-instructions).

Your node will be placed on both our public and curated node lists, and aside from allowing us to show dots all over the world, will help us better understand network dynamics and emergent effects stemming from our propagation strategies.

To apply for the programme, send an application including your name, meetup group name/town and an address for shipment to epi@ethereum.org.

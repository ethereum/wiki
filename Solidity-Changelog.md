 * Improved error messages for unexpected tokens.

### 0.1.6 (2015-10-16)

 * `.push()` for dynamic storage arrays.
 * Tuple expressions (`(1,2,3)` or `return (1,2,3);`)

 * Destructuring assignment (`(x,y,) = (1,2,3)`)
 * Bugfix: Internal error about usage of library function with invalid types.
 * Bugfix: Correctly parse `Library.structType a` at statement level.
 * Bugfix: Correctly report source locations of parenthesized expressions (as part of "tuple" story).

### 0.1.5 (2015-10-07)

 * Breaking change in storage encoding: Encode short byte arrays and strings together with their length in storage.
 * Report warnings
 * Allow storage reference types for public library functions.
 * Access to types declared in other contracts and libraries via `.`.
 * Version stamp at beginning of runtime bytecode of libraries.
 * Bugfix: Problem with initialized string state variables and dynamic data in constructor.
 * Bugfix: Resolve dependencies concerning `new` automatically.

### 0.1.4 (2015-09-30)

 * Bugfix: Returning fixed-size arrays.
 * Bugfix: combined-json output of solc.

### 0.1.3 (2015-09-25)

 * `throw` statement.
 * Libraries that contain functions which are called via CALLCODE.
 * Linker stage for compiler to insert other contract's addresses (used for libraries).

 * Compile-time out of bounds check for access to fixed-size arrays by integer constants.
 * Version string includes libevmasm/libethereum's version (contains the optimizer).
 * Bugfix: Accessors for constant public state variables.
 * Bugfix: Propagate exceptions in clone contracts.
 * Bugfix: Empty single-line comments are now treated properly.

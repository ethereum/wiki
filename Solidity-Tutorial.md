Solidity is a high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to compile to code for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This
tutorial starts with a basic introduction to Solidity and assumes some knowledge of
the Ethereum Virtual Machine and programming in general. It tries to explain all features present in the language but does not cover features like
the [natural language specification](Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format)
or formal verification and is also not meant as a final specification
of the language.

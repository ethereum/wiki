# Welcome to the Ethereum Wiki

This is the community maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform built by the Ethereum Foundation, including **Ethereum**, _the generalized blockchain for smart contract development_, as well as sister protocols like **Whisper**, _the private low-level datagram communication platform_, and **Swarm**.

## Status 

### Frontier

Version 1.0 of Ethereum aka Frontier was released on July 30th 2015! Development continues towards the versions named Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity (v1.1). Frontier is aimed at exchangers and [miners](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining). Homestead is aiming for [√êapps developers](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial), while Metropolis is aiming for end users with the release of the Mist browser. Serenity is meant to move from consensus through [Proof-of-Work](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash) to [Proof-of-Stake](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/).

## Getting started
To get the basic concepts of Ethereum visit the Ethereum homepage over at [http://ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/). If you want to get a deeper understanding, start by read the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and the [design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale). For a more formal review, read the [yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf). See the [development tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial) for quick start to developing smart contracts.

## Don't get lost
Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary) and our [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/FAQ). There are separate wikis for information relevant to the [C++](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki) and [Go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki) implementations (Python and Javascript coming soon),

## Downloads

# Welcome to the Ethereum Wiki

This is the community maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform built by the Ethereum Foundation, including **Ethereum**, _the generalized blockchain for smart contract development_, as well as sister protocols like **Whisper**, _the private low-level datagram communication platform_, and **Swarm**.

## Contribution guidelines

Users signed in with GitHub can edit and add pages using the [browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface) or [locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally). Do not change the title of a page, as the link for it will change. In particular, if you change the title for this page, the link https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/, as well as the Wiki tab in the header of this repo, will just direct to a list of pages, rather than this page, so don't change the title of this page! If you want to translate a page, create a new page and translate the original there. Consider previewing your changes before saving them, and if you detect any errors, fix them.

## Getting started

To get the basic concepts of Ethereum visit [http://ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/). For another introduction targeted for end users but also for developers and others, see [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-introduction). If you want to get a deeper understanding, start by reading the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and the [design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale). For a more formal review, read the [yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf). If you are interested in being a core developer, find a project that interests you, and start contributing to that (probably pro-bono initially, until maintainers like you and decide to hire you). For Ethereum research and protocol architecture, visit [https://ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/). If you are interested in developing smart contracts you can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Programming_languages), as well as under √êApp Development in the sidebar.

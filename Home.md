## Status

### Spurious Dragon

The fourth major live release of Ethereum aka Spurious Dragon was released in Nov 2016. Development continues towards the versions named Metropolis and Serenity (v1.1). Spurious Dragon is aiming for [Dapp developers](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Dapp-Developer-Resources) as well as end users for limited categories of applications, and has a number of security enhancements compared to previous versions, and the upcoming Metropolis is aiming to introduce various privacy and functionality improvements that are listed under the "Accepted EIPs" heading [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs). Serenity is meant to move from consensus through [Proof-of-Work](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash) to [Proof-of-Stake](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ). Further releases will focus on massive scalability increases through [sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ) as well as virtual machine improvements and other features.
